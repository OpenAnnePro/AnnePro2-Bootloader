# Anne Pro 2 Bootloader Reverse Engineering

This repository contains a dump of the Anne Pro 2 Keyboard bootloader. This bootloader resides on the Keyboard Matrix
controller IC (U2). This is the code that runs when you boot the uController while holding down `esc` key.

The `bootloader.bin` file is a direct dump of the flash content. Meanwhile the `bootloader.idb` is an IDA database
for my current reversing work.
